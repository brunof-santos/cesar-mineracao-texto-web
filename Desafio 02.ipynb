Lockheed developed this\n","     for the Air Force.\n","  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n","     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n","     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n","     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n","     source for 30 day missions.\n","  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n","     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n","     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n","     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n","     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n","     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n","     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n","  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n","     add another 20 kW of power\n","  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n","     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n","     Vehicle).\n","\n","Option \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\n","The Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\n","This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\n","have all come to know and love :)\n","\n","This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\n","use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \n","number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\n","for both options \"A\" and \"B\".\n","\n","The build-up occurs in six phases:\n","  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n","     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n","     it visits.\n","  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n","     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n","     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n","  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n","     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n","     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n","     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n","  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\n","     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n","     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n","  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n","     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n","     assembly in 24 flights.\n","\n","Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \n","with the exception of the data management system, which has major\n","changes.\n","\n","Option C - Single Core Launch Station.\n","This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\n","cylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\n","the backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \n","regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\n","motors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\n","  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\n","  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\n","  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\n","    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\n","  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\n","  - 7 berthing ports\n","  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\n","    (twice the volume of skylab).\n","  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\n","  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\n","  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\n","    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\n","  - increased crew time for utilization\n","  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\n","\n","========== Doc 14 ==========\n","From: jllee@acsu.buffalo.edu (Johnny L Lee)\n","Subject: RE:  == MOVING SALE ===\n","Summary: RE:  === MOVING SALE ===\n","Organization: UB\n","Lines: 44\n","Nntp-Posting-Host: lictor.acsu.buffalo.edu\n","\n","Reduced Prices! \n","I have a list of things forsale on behalf of my brother, who's moving (moved\n","already)\n","\n","\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffer:\n","1) Black and Decker Duster Plus (Portable Hand Vaccum)\t\n"," \tpurchased for $32, \t\t\t\t\t  $12\n","\n","2) SR-1000 Dual Cassette Portable Player, AM/FM\n","5-Band graphics Equalizer, high speed dubing, Duo \n","Tape.Tape deck A, seems to have lost treble sound. \n","But, I bet  it's fixable.\n","\tpurchased for $80\t\t\t\t\t  $25\n","\n","3)Monolux Zoom MicroScope, up to 1200X magnification\n","Made in Japan, includes case and accessories\n","\tpurchased for $50\t\t\t\t\t  $20\n","\n","4)Sunbeam 1400 Hair Dryer, the dryer you put your \n","head under/into.
